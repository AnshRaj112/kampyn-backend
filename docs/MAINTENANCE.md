## üõ†Ô∏è Routine Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Database Backups
- **Frequency:** Daily (full), Hourly (incremental)
- **Tools:** MongoDB Atlas Backup, mongodump/mongorestore
- **Procedure:**
  1. Schedule automated backups using MongoDB Atlas or cron jobs.
  2. Store backups in secure, offsite locations (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
  3. Test restore process monthly to ensure backup integrity.
- **Retention Policy:**
  - Daily backups: 7 days
  - Weekly backups: 4 weeks
  - Monthly backups: 6 months

### 2. Log Rotation & Archiving
- **Frequency:** Daily rotation, 30-day retention
- **Tools:** PM2, logrotate, Winston, Morgan
- **Procedure:**
  1. Configure log rotation for application and system logs.
  2. Archive logs older than 30 days to cold storage.
  3. Monitor log disk usage and set alerts for high usage.

### 3. Dependency Updates
- **Frequency:** Weekly
- **Tools:** npm audit, Snyk, Dependabot
- **Procedure:**
  1. Run `npm audit` and `npm outdated` weekly.
  2. Apply security patches immediately.
  3. Test all updates in staging before production deployment.

### 4. System Monitoring
- **Frequency:** Continuous
- **Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, PM2, custom health checks
- **Procedure:**
  1. Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
  2. Set up alerts for high resource usage or downtime.
  3. Review system health dashboards daily.

### 5. Health Checks
- **Frequency:** Every 5 minutes
- **Tools:** Custom `/api/health` endpoint, external uptime monitoring (e.g., UptimeRobot)
- **Procedure:**
  1. Ensure `/api/health` returns status 200 and correct data.
  2. Investigate and resolve any failed health checks immediately.

## üîÑ Operational Procedures

### 1. Deployment
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)
  - [ ] Staging environment matches production
  - [ ] Database migrations applied
  - [ ] Rollback plan in place
  - [ ] Monitoring enabled
- **Zero Downtime:** Use PM2 cluster mode and rolling restarts

### 2. Scaling
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more PM2/Node.js instances
- **Vertical Scaling:** Increase server resources (CPU, RAM)
- **Database Scaling:** Use MongoDB sharding/replica sets

### 3. Incident Response
- **Immediate Actions:**
  1. Triage and classify incident severity
  2. Notify stakeholders and security team
  3. Isolate affected systems if needed
- **Post-Incident:**
  1. Document root cause and resolution
  2. Update runbooks and documentation
  3. Conduct post-mortem review

### 4. Data Restoration
- **Procedure:**
  1. Identify required backup snapshot
  2. Restore using `mongorestore` or Atlas restore tools
  3. Validate data integrity and application functionality

## üßπ Housekeeping

- **Remove unused data:** Archive or delete old orders, logs, and analytics data as per retention policy
- **Clear cache:** Periodically clear Redis or in-memory caches to prevent stale data
- **Review user accounts:** Deactivate or remove inactive or suspicious accounts
- **Update environment variables:** Rotate secrets and credentials quarterly

## üßë‚Äçüíª Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue                        | Steps to Diagnose & Resolve                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Server not starting          | Check logs, verify environment variables, check DB connection|
| High memory/CPU usage        | Profile with PM2, check for memory leaks, optimize queries   |
| Slow API responses           | Check DB indexes, review slow query logs, optimize endpoints |
| Failed health checks         | Check dependencies (DB, Redis), restart affected services    |
| Payment failures             | Check Razorpay logs, verify credentials, retry transaction   |
| Email/OTP not sent           | Check SMTP logs, verify email service credentials            |
| Data inconsistency           | Run data validation scripts, restore from backup if needed   |
